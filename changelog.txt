1.1.1
---
New features and changes
* New csvToObject and objectToCsv methods to read and write CSV data as an
  array of objects.
* Converted build system from Apache Ant to Grunt.
* Converted documentation from JSDoc to YUIDoc.

Bug fixes
* If an undefined value is in the input to arrayToCsv it will now be considered
  an empty field.
* When reading CSV files unquoted numbers are treated as numbers even with
  leading or trailing whitespace.

1.1.0
---
* Added support for use as a CommonJS module.  This enables using UCSV as a
  library in Mozilla (Jetpack) Add-ons.  It should also allow use in Node.js
  environments. Moved the strict mode declaration into the closure and cleaned
  up some other formatting to make JSLint happy.

1.0.3
---
* Bug fix in arrayToCsv.  arrayToCsv now wraps lines containing newline
  characters with double-quotes as was originally intended. Thanks goes to Colin
  Keenan for discovering and reporting this bug. (http://code.google.com/p/rentap/)

1.0.2
---
* csvToArray now returns empty fields as nulls instead of empty strings as
  suggested by Leon Bambrick (http://secretGeek.net).
* csvToArray now converts non-quoted integers and floats to the appropriate type
  instead of assuming they are strings.

* Minor spelling fix.

1.0.1
---
* A couple of tweaks to get JSLint passing again.
* Removed the global flag from the trim function's RegExps to improve the performance.
